# SYNCANO OPEN-SOURCES DASHBOARD PLATFORM BUILT WITH REACT
Opens access to help developers get their apps into the world faster, and more easily.

OCTOBER, 6th, 2016 - Syncano announced today that it has open-sourced its Dashboard platform, so that more developers will be able to access the libraries and repositories to help them build apps faster.
 
Up to now, Syncano’s Dashboard has been a private project. With the company’s release of the [Dashboard on GitHub](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-dashboard?utm_source=reactjsnews&utm_campaign=open-source-dashboard&utm_medium=post), a new repository has been created that allows contributions, pull requests, and issue requests from any developer with a GitHub account. Developers can also:
 
* contribute their own development ideas to the project
* help identify bugs or other issues
* improve the code of the application
* implement features they see as important
 
Syncano CEO Nikolai Fasting said, “We open-sourced our Dashboard to find talent, allow outside developers to give their input on what’s important and what needs to be fixed, and show the tech world that we’re determined to make the best product for our customers.”
 
The Dashboard is mainly written in React, because it is well-suited to applications using data that changes over time,  it makes it very easy to build reusable components, and it works well with other technologies. Open-sourcing the Dashboard is part of the initial vision of Syncano, which has already open-sourced all of its libraries and home page, even from their beta versions.
 
Fasting said, “We want developers to build better apps faster, so to do that we’re calling for community assistance. We’re encouraging discussion to bring all of these brilliant minds together to make this product the best it can be.”
 
By open-sourcing Syncano’s Dashboard, the company also seeks to find gifted developers – either for possible employment opportunities or Ambassador Program opportunities. As an added benefit, It opens up two-way transparency, where developers have the chance to learn from Syncano’s code, and Syncano gains a window onto what features and functions are important.
